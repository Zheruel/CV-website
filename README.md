# CV Website

Material Design styled website created to serve as my portfolio.

Technologies used: HTML/CSS + (Bootrap, Material Design), Javascript + (JQuery)

See live at http://tinzeljar.com/

Note: the site is using minified .css and .js files on the index page because I am actually hosting it. The non-minified files are available in the same directory.
